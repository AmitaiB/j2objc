j2objc
======

Web site project for http://j2objc.org.

This site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's authored using
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which uses the same Markdown as
GitHub.

To work on this site, clone it to a local repository, then follow the setup instructions on 
[Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). Next, run:

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

This starts the Jekyll server, which can be viewed on [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

**Note**: it's important to configure Jekyll locally so it generates the same
site as GitHub Pages will. Refer to the 
[Troubleshooting section](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#troubleshooting)
for details.
