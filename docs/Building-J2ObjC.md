# Building J2ObjC

### Requirements

- Apple Mac OS X system
- Latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.php)
- Apache Maven

Note: Maven is no longer distributed with Xcode's command-line tools. Here is [a well-written installation guide by Pankaj Kumar](http://www.journaldev.com/2348/how-to-install-maven-on-mac-os-x-mavericks-10-9).

### Building J2ObjC

To build from a command-line in a Terminal window, run:
```` 
$ make dist
````
to build the full distribution,
```` 
$ make test
````
to run all unit tests, and
```` 
$ make clean
````
to remove all files generated by the build.

### Parallel Builds

The J2ObjC build supports parallel builds, which are specified using the `-j<n>` flag, where _n_ is the maximum number of concurrent tasks. The maximum depends on how fast/powerful your system is; we suggest starting with `-j4`. Increase the number to shorten build times if your system can handle it, and decrease it if make fails with system errors.
