# Memory Management

The first question most Java developers have is how is memory management implemented by J2ObjC, since Java has garbage collection and Objective-C doesn't by default.  What iOS does have are [two methods of memory management](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html): reference counting, and Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  

J2ObjC generates different memory management code, depending on which method is chosen.  By default, it currently uses reference counting.  Translate with the `-use-arc` option to generate code which uses ARC (soon we plan on making that option the default).

## Reference Counting

The [reference counting method](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000994-BAJHFBGH) makes object ownership explicit.  A method owns an object when it creates it, until it releases that object.  When receiving an object from another method, the receiving method retains the object.  When it no longer needs the object, it must release the object.  When an object's retain count is zero, its memory is freed and the object is no longer valid. When objects are freed, their dealloc() method is called to release ownership of their instance variables.  

Instead of releasing an object, a method may send it an autorelease message, which defers the release message.  This allows a method to create an object to be returned, and relinquish its ownership without invalidating the object. At regular intervals (such as after each event loop iteration in an iOS application) the autorelease pool is "drained", meaning all objects in that pool are released. Any objects whose retain counts drop to zero are freed as normal.

Because the burden on memory management is on the developer, it's easy to leak memory with the reference counting method.  However, Apple recommends some [best practices](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW1) to minimize this problem, which J2ObjC implements.  

There is also runtime and tool support to detect memory leaks.  The Objective-C runtime reports any detected leaks when an application exits, which is one reason why J2ObjC translates JUnit tests into executable binaries. Xcode uses Clang, and that compiler has excellent static analysis for memory problems, which Xcode makes available with its Analyze command.

## Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)

[ARC](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226) is Apple's recommended memory management method.  It moves the responsibility for reference counting to the compiler, which adds the appropriate retain, release and autorelease methods during compilation.  ARC supports weak references for devices running iOS 5 and later. 

Not all projects use ARC, though, as it is sometimes slower than hand-written code. We recommend that new projects use ARC, and only fall-back to manual reference counting if profiling data shows a real performance issue.

## Weak References

J2ObjC supports the `WeakReference` class, so Java code that uses it will work the same way when translated.  Fields can also be annotated with [com.google.devtools.j2objc.Weak](Weak), which the transpiler uses to generate fields that follow Objective-C weak reference semantics.  When using reference counting, this means that the field is not retained when initialized, and it is autoreleased when the containing instance is released.  With ARC, weak fields are marked with the `__weak` annotation, and the related properties are declared weak.

In some cases, an inner class instance gets in a reference cycle with its outer instance.  Here, a [com.google.devtools.j2objc.WeakOuter](WeakOuter) annotation is used to mark the inner class, so the reference to the outer class is treated as described above.  Other fields in the inner class are not affected by this annotation.

## Memory Management Tools

- [[Cycle Finder Tool]] - analyzes Java source files for strong object reference cycles.
- [Xcode Instruments](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/InstrumentsQuickStart/InstrumentsQuickStart.html) - Xcode's suite of profiling tools.
- [Xcode Memory Diagnostics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/recipes/xcode_help-scheme_editor/Articles/SchemeDiagnostics.html) - build options for running with memory diagnostics and logging.
