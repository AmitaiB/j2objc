# Using J2ObjC with Eclipse

Hemanta Sapkota has developed an 
[Eclipse plug-in](https://github.com/hemantasapkota/j2objc-eclipse-plugin)
that adds support for J2ObjC development.  From the project's site:

> J2ObjC Eclipse Plugin, as the name says is an Eclipse plugin for interfacing
> Google's j2objc compiler in Eclipse. It allows you to generate Objective-C
> source codes from existing Java projects in Eclipse. In addition, most of
> the command line parameters required by the j2objc compiler is supported as
> preferences in the plugin. 

Since J2ObjC is focused on iOS development and so only runs on Macs, the
J2ObjC Eclipse Plugin also requires a Mac OS X system.
